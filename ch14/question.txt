First, write a simple program called null.c that creates a pointer to an integer, sets it to NULL, and then tries to dereference it.
Compile this into an executable called null.
What happens when you run this program?
Next, compile this program with symbol information included (with the -g flag). Doing so let's put more information into the executable, enabling the debugger to access more useful information about variable names and the like.
Run the program under the debugger by typing gdb null and then, once gdb is running, typing run.
What does gdb show you?
Finally, use the valgrind tool on this program. We'll use memcheck that is a part of valgrind to analyze what happens.
Run this by typing in the following: valgrind --leak-check=yes null.
What happens when you run this? Can you interpret the output from the tool?
Write a simple program that allocates memory using malloc() but forgets to free it before exiting.
What happens when this program runs?
Can you use gdb to find any problems with it?
How about valgrind (again with the --leak-check=yes flag)?
Write a program that creates an array of integers called data of size 100 using malloc; then, set data[100] to zero.
What happens when you run this program?
What happens when you run this program using valgrind? Is the program correct?
Create a program that allocates an array of integers (as above), frees them, and then tries to print the value of one of the elements of the array.
Does the program run?
What happens when you use valgrind on it?
Now pass a funny value to free (e.g., a pointer in the middle of the array you allocated above).
What happens? Do you need tools to find this type of problem?
Submission Guidelines

Put all source code files in a zip file name them as Q<Question-No>.
Create a makefile to compile all of them.
Take screenshots of output as proof-of-work and include in the zipfile as named as Q<Question-No>.<image-extension>.
The zip file should be named as <Roll-no>.zip.
